# 📄 Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

This project implements a **Speech-to-Text transcription system** using Python. It is designed to take audio input, process it through a speech recognition engine, and output the corresponding text, making it ideal for transcription tasks.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Converts spoken language in audio files into written text.
- Useful for applications like meeting transcriptions, voice note digitization, and accessibility features.
- Designed for flexibility and ease of use in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload and process `.wav` or other supported audio formats.
- Use of Python libraries such as `speech_recognition` and `pydub`.
- Interactive interface using Jupyter for step-by-step exploration and customization.
- Error handling and audio pre-processing for better accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- `speech_recognition`
- `pydub`
- `IPython.display`
- `os`, `shutil`, `wave`, and other standard libraries

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pydub
```

3. For `pydub`, make sure you have `ffmpeg` installed:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# MacOS with Homebrew
brew install ffmpeg
```

## 📈 Usage

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb
```

2. Upload your audio file and follow the notebook steps to convert speech to text.

3. View or save the transcribed output.

## 📝 Output

- Plain text transcription of audio files.
- Displayed within the notebook and optionally saved as a `.txt` file.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Accuracy depends on audio clarity, background noise, and speaker accent.
- Recommended to use clean `.wav` files for best results.
